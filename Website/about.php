        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p>In order to register any lost pets you may have found, you must sign up as a rescuer. This will give you special access to the register pets section, where a variety of options are available to register the pet you have found.</p>
        <h3>Adoption</h3>
        <p>PetLovers provides an adoption service as well. Through this service any user that wishes to adopt an animal that was rescued by another user can do so. However, before an adoption is approved the user must complete a special form in order to see if he or she qualifies to take care of said pet. </p>
        <p>Finally, all adoption forms are visible to the pet's current owner. These forms are monitored by said users, and they are ultimately responsible to make sure whether someone is qualified or not qualified to handle a pet.</p>
